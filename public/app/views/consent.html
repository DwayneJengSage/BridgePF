<h3>Consent to Participate in Our Study</h3>

<p>This would be the consent form, whatever that eventually looks like for the desktop consent process. </p>

<div class="topSpacer">
	<button ng-click="agree()" class="btn btn-primary">I agree to participate</button>
	<button ng-click="decline()" class="btn btn-warning">I do not agree</button>
</div>
