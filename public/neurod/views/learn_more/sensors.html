    <ul>
        <li>to record variations in your voice by saying “aaah” for 10-20 
        seconds into the microphone</li>
        
        <li>to hold your phone, walk 20 steps forward then 20 steps 
        backward to assess your posture and stability.</li>
        
        <li>to tap on the phone screen in a specific way to test your 
        reaction time and dexterity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These tasks should take you about 20 minutes each week. You have 
    the right to refuse to answer particular questions or participate
