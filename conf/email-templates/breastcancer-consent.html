  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>You are invited to participate in a research study to understand variations in
  symptoms during recovery from breast cancer treatment. This study is designed for women
  between 18 and 80 years old with a history of breast cancer treatment and women without
  any history of cancer. Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary.</p>

  <p>To be in a research study you must give your informed consent. The purpose of this
  form is to help you decide if you want to participate in this study. Please read the
  information carefully. If you decide to take part in this research study, you will be
  given a copy of this signed and dated consent form. If you decide to participate, you
  are free to withdraw your consent, and to discontinue participation at any time.</p>

  <p>You should not join the research study until all of your questions are answered.</p>

  <p>Participating in a research study is not the same as receiving medical care. The
  decision to join or not join the research study will not affect your medical
  benefits.</p>

  <h3>Purpose of the Study</h3>

  <p>Women recovering from breast cancer treatment can have very different and more or
  less severe symptoms day to day. These symptoms affect quality of life and make
  managing recovery difficult. We would like to understand the causes of these symptom
  variations.</p>

  <p>New technologies allow people to record and track their health and symptoms in real
  time. This study will monitor your health and symptoms using questionnaires and sensors
  via a mobile phone application.</p>

  <p>If you decide to join the study you will need to download the study application on
  your mobile device. Then, periodically we will ask you to answer questions and/or
  perform some tasks on your mobile phone. These questions may be about your health,
  exercise, diet, sleep and medicines, in addition to some more general health surveys.
  The tasks may include exercising or journaling about your week. Your study data will
  include your responses to surveys and tasks and some measurements from the phone itself
  about how you are moving and interacting with others.</p>

  <p>Your data, without your name, will be added to the data of other study participants
  and made available to groups of researchers worldwide for analysis and future research.
  You also will have a unique account that you can use to review your own data. We
  anticipate this study will be open for multiple years, during which time your data will
  remain available to you to review. We anticipate enrolling 20,000 subjects in this
  study.</p>

  <h3>Procedures</h3>

  <p>What will you be asked to do?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Download a mobile app (free) and register an account: You need to have the study
    app on your phone, register an account and confirm your agreement to participate in
    this study. Registration will include entering your name, email address and other
    general information about yourself to verify your eligibility.</li>

    <li>Health Surveys: We will ask you to answer questions about yourself, your medical
    history, and your current health. You may choose to leave any questions that you do
    not wish to answer blank. We will ask you to rate your fatigue, cognition, sleep,
    mood and exercise performance on a scale of 1 to 5 daily. In addition to these daily
    questions we will ask you to answer brief weekly and monthly surveys about your
    symptoms in order to track any changes.</li>

    <li>Tasks: Occasionally we will ask you to perform specific tasks while using your
    mobile phone and record sensor data directly from your phone. For example, you may be
    asked to type a short journal entry, which will then be shared and analyzed for
    typing speed and accuracy as well as word usage. Additionally, you may be asked to
    provide data from third-party fitness devices (like the Fitbit or Jawbone Up) with
    your permission.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will send notices on your phone asking you to complete these tasks and surveys.
  You may choose to act at your convenience, (either then or later) and you may choose to
  participate in all or only in some parts of the study. These surveys and tasks should
  take you about 20 minutes each week. You have the right to refuse to answer particular
  questions and the right to participate in particular aspects of the study.</p>

  <p>What we will and will not do with the data?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>De-identification: In order to preserve your privacy, we will use a random code
    instead of your name on all your study data. This unique code cannot be used to
    directly identify you. Any data that directly identifies you will be removed before
    the data is transferred for analysis, although researchers will have the ability to
    contact you if you have chosen to allow them to do so. We will never sell, rent or
    lease your contact information.</li>

    <li>Use in research: We will combine your study data including survey responses and
    other measurements with those of other study participants. The combined data will be
    transferred to Synapse, a computational research platform, for analysis. The research
    team will analyze the combined data and report findings back to the community through
    Blog or scientific publications. The combined study data on Synapse will also be
    available to use for other research purposes and will be shared with registered users
    worldwide who agree to using the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm and not
    attempt to re-identify or re-contact you unless you have chosen to allow them to do
    so.</li>

    <li>We will NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, text or email
    message content, or websites visited.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Risks, Discomforts, and Inconveniences</h3>

  <p>There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study.
  These deserve careful thought.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>This is not a treatment study and we do not expect any medical side effects from
    participating.</li>

    <li>Some survey questions may make you feel uncomfortable. Know that the information
    you provide is entirely up to you and you are free to skip questions that you do not
    want to answer.</li>

    <li>Other people may glimpse the study notifications and/or reminders on your phone
    and realize you are enrolled in this study. This can make some people feel
    self-conscious. You can avoid this discomfort by putting a passcode on your phone to
    block unauthorized users from accessing your phone content.</li>

    <li>Be safe&#8212;just as you would not text while driving, do not fulfill study
    tasks while driving. Wait until you are in a safe place to perform tasks!</li>

    <li>You may have concerns about data security, privacy and confidentiality. We take
    great care to protect your information, however there is a slight risk of loss of
    privacy. This is a low risk because we separate your personal information
    (information that can directly identify you, such as your name or phone number) from
    the research data to respect your privacy. However, even with removal of this
    information, it is sometimes possible to re-identify an individual given enough
    cross-reference information about him or her. This risk, while very low, should still
    be contemplated prior to enrolling.</li>

    <li>Data collected in this study will count against your existing mobile data plan.
    You may configure the application to only use WiFi connections to limit the impact
    this data collection has on your data plan.</li>

    <li>Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this
    time.</li>

    <li>You will be told about any new information that might change your decision to be
    in this study.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Potential Benefits</h3>

  <p>The goal of this study is to create knowledge that can benefit us as a society. The
  benefits are primarily the creation of insights to help current and future patients and
  their families to better detect, understand and manage their health. We will return the
  insights learned from analysis of the study data through the study website, but these
  insights may not be of direct benefit to you. We cannot, and thus we do not, guarantee
  or promise that you will personally receive any direct benefits from this study.
  However you will be able to track your health and export your data at will to share
  with your medical doctor and anyone you choose.</p>

  <h3>Payment</h3>

  <p>You will not be paid for being in this study.</p>

  <h3>Costs</h3>

  <p>There is no cost to you to participate in this study other than to your mobile data
  plan if applicable.</p>

  <h3>Alternatives</h3>

  <p>Since no medical treatments are provided during this study there are no alternative
  therapies. The only alternative is to not participate.</p>

  <h3>Authorization to Use and Disclose Information for Research Purposes</h3>

  <p>Because information about you and your health is personal and private, it generally
  cannot be used in a research study without your written authorization. If you sign this
  consent form, you will provide that authorization. You do not have to sign this form.
  But if you do not, you will not be able to participate in this research study.</p>

  <p>What personal information will be used or disclosed? Your personal health
  information that may be used or disclosed in connection with this research study, may
  include, but is not limited to your body height, weight, gender, age, ethnicity/race,
  health history, answers to study questions, and health information that may be
  discernable from your mobile phone&#8217;s sensors. Your account information, study
  data and signed consent form may also be looked at and/or copied by designated
  personnel for regulatory and quality assurance. WE WILL NEVER SELL, RENT OR LEASE YOUR
  CONTACT INFORMATION.</p>

  <p>Who may use and disclose my data? The study sponsor, investigators, study
  coordinators and study staff may use and disclose your personal information to do the
  research described above or as required by law (e.g. to prevent possible injury to
  yourself or others). Any registered Synapse user may analyze the combined study data
  however no name or contact information will be included in this dataset.</p>

  <p>Who May Receive or Use the Information? The parties listed in the preceding
  paragraph may disclose your health information as required by law to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The US National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office for Human
    Research Protection, The Food and Drug Administration and other agencies as
    required,</li>

    <li>Governmental agencies in other countries,</li>

    <li>Western Institutional Review Board&#174; (WIRB&#174;) or other Institutional
    Review Board who watch over the safety, effectiveness and conduct of the
    research,</li>

    <li>Others, if the law requires</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When will my authorization expire? Your authorization for the use and/or disclosure
  of your health information will expire December 31, 2060.</p>

  <p>If you choose to withdraw from the research study, we will stop to collect your
  study data. At the end of the study period we will stop collecting your data, even if
  the application remains on your phone and you keep using it. If you were interested in
  joining another study afterward, we would ask you to complete another consent, like
  this one, explaining the risks and benefits of the new study.</p>

  <h3>Confidentiality</h3>

  <p>We are committed to protect your privacy. Your identity will be kept as confidential
  as possible. Except as required by law, you will not be identified by name or by any
  other direct personal identifier. We will use a random code number instead of your name
  on all your data collected, analyzed, aggregated and released to researchers.
  Information about the code will be kept in a secure system. This study anticipates that
  your data will be added to a combined study dataset placed in a
  &#8220;repository&#8221; - an online database&#8212;like Sage Bionetworks Synapse where
  other researchers can access it. No name or contact information will be included in
  this combined study dataset. Researchers will have access to all the study data but
  will be unable to easily map any particular data to the identities of the participants.
  However, there is always a risk that the database can be breached by hackers, or that
  experts in re-identification may attempt to reverse our processes. Total
  confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.</p>

  <h3>Compensation for Injury</h3>

  <p>THIS STUDY DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY COMPENSATION, HEALTH OR MEDICAL CARE TO
  PARTICIPANTS.</p>

  <p>If you are injured as a direct result of your participation in this study, the
  Principal Investigator or the medical monitor and the research study staff will assist
  you in obtaining appropriate medical treatment. Your medical insurance, managed care
  plan, or other benefits program will be billed for this treatment. You will be
  responsible for any associated co-payments or deductibles as required by your
  insurance.</p>

  <p>If costs of care related to such an injury are not covered by your medical
  insurance, managed care plan or other benefits program, you may be responsible for
  these costs. The sponsor will not routinely pay charges that your insurance does not
  cover. No payment is routinely available from the study sponsor.</p>

  <h3>Voluntary Participation and Withdrawal</h3>

  <p>Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to sign this consent
  form. But if you do not, you will not be able to participate in this research study.
  You may decide not to participate or you may leave the study at any time. Your decision
  will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You are not obligated to participate in this study.</li>

    <li>Your questions should be answered clearly and to your satisfaction, before you
    choose to participate in the study.</li>

    <li>You have a right to download or transfer a copy of all of your study data.</li>

    <li>By agreeing to participate you do not waive any of your legal rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To withdraw from this study please contact the Study Principal Investigator Dr.
  Stephen Friend by email <a href="mailto:BCSApp@sagebase.org">BCSApp@sagebase.org</a> or
  call <a href="tel:12066672103">+1-206-667-2103</a>.</p>

  <p>If you withdraw from the study, we will stop collecting new data, but the
  de-identified data that you have already provided will not be able to be destroyed or
  deleted. Your identity will not be kept.</p>

  <p>The Study Principal Investigator or the sponsor may also withdraw you from the study
  without your consent at any time for any reason, including if it is in your best
  interest, you do not consent to continue in the study after being told of changes in
  the research that may affect you, or if the study is cancelled.</p>

  <h3>Use of Data for Future Research</h3>

  <p>Several databases are available to help researchers understand different diseases.
  These databases contain information and other data helpful to study diseases. This
  study will include your research data into one such database, Synapse, to be used in
  future research beyond this study. Your data may benefit future research.</p>

  <p>Before your data is released to the Synapse database, your personal contact
  information such as your name, e-mail, etc, will be removed. Your unique code
  identifier will be used in place of your name when your data is released onto Synapse.
  The study data will be made available on Synapse to registered users who have agreed to
  using the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm and not attempt to re-identify or
  re-contact you unless you have chosen to allow them to do so. The Principal
  Investigator and Sponsor will have no oversight on the future use of the study data
  released through Synapse.</p>

  <p>Although you can withdraw from the study at any time, you cannot withdraw the
  de-identified data that have already been distributed through research databases.</p>

  <p>The main risk of donating your de-identified data to a centralized database is the
  potential loss of privacy and confidentiality in case of public disclosure due to
  unintended data breaches, including hacking or other activities outside of the
  procedures authorized by the study. In such a case, your data may be misused or used
  for unauthorized purposes by someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to try to
  re-identify you. This risk is low.</p>

  <h3>Source of Funding for the Study</h3>

  <p>The sponsor is Sage Bionetworks <a href=
  "http://sagebase.org/">http://sagebase.org/</a> with some funding from the Robert Wood
  Johnson Foundation.</p>
