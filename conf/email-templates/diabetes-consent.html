<h3>About this consent form</h3>

<p>Please read this form carefully. It tells you important information about a research study. A member of our research team is available to communicate with you about taking part in this research study if you have questions. 

<p>People who agree to take part in research studies are called &ldquo;subjects&rdquo;. This term will be used throughout this consent form. Partners HealthCare System is made up of Partners hospitals (including Massachusetts General Hospital, where this study originates), health care providers, and researchers. In the rest of this consent form, we refer to the Partners system simply as &ldquo;Partners&rdquo;.

<p>If you have any questions about the research or about this form, please ask us. Taking part in this research study is voluntary and is up to you. If you decide to take part in this research study, you must sign this form to show that you want to take part. We will give you a signed copy of this form to keep.

<h3>Why is this research study being done?</h3>

<p>Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, affecting 25.8 million children and adults in the United States (8.3% of the population). Diet and exercise have been shown to play an important role in type 2 diabetes, and also to decrease the rate of progression of pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes. However, it is extremely difficult to start and maintain healthy changes in health behaviors such as a health diet, regular exercise, and taking all medications regularly. 

<p>Today&rsquo;s mobile phones (especially smartphones) are becoming powerful platforms for communicating, computing and sensing. We are investigating ways to help people make use of the capabilities of their smart phones to improve their health, and in this particular study, to more successfully manage their type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes. (In this document, we will use the phrase &lsquo;type 2 diabetes&rsquo; to refer to either type 2 diabetes or its precursor, pre-diabetes). A recent report by the Diabetes Prevention Program showed that the two of the principal obstacles in lifestyle modifications were lack of social support and poor food & exercise tracking.  Smartphones are a promising technology to help individuals overcome these challenges.

<p>This study will make available to the public a free app that users can install on their smartphones.  The app will provide a variety of services to help users track their daily behaviors (such as activity/exercise, eating, logging blood glucose checks, and taking medications).  Moreover, it will help them gain insight into their behavior patterns while attempting to encourage healthy activities. For instance, by analyzing the glucose, diet and exercise data, the app can give users personal insights into what food items and exercise patterns are most commonly associated with optimal levels of blood glucose. The app will also allow users to share their accomplishments and compete with their designated &lsquo;buddies&rsquo;, to enable social support for health behaviors. At the same time, app data will be stripped of any features that might be personally identifiable (such as names or email addresses), and each user&rsquo;s app data will be associated with only a random user ID number. By analyzing this de-identified data across all app users, researchers can better understand the relationships between food, exercise, medications and blood glucose levels in large numbers of people with type 2 diabetes. 

<p>In summary, this app will provide features that utilize smartphone technology to make it much easier for users to record food items, exercise/physical activity and blood glucose levels. The app will provide personalized analyses to give the user insights into which of their behaviors are associated with optimal control of their type 2 diabetes, and provide social supports for healthy behavior change through communication and competition with &lsquo;buddies&rsquo;. By analyzing anonymized data from users, researchers will be able to better understand the how diet, exercise and medications affect glucose levels and type 2 diabetes control.

<p>Specific Aim 1. Have a large cohort of users download, install, and use the app.  The app will be made available to the public via the Apple iTunes Store at no cost.  This study aims to capture data (or have users enter information) related to several key activities for T2D management: 1) exercise/activity (passively collected by the phone), 2) food consumption, 3) blood glucose measurements, 4) medications (only those traditionally used for diabetes or cardiovascular management).

<p>Specific Aim 2. Test whether daily health behaviors are altered by displaying tracked health behavior to users on their smartphones. Specifically, the app will make available to each user summaries of their activity level, eating habits, medication adherence, and blood glucose levels.  We will assess whether providing this information to users correlates with outcomes including blood glucose levels, activity levels, dietary choices, and medication compliance. Secondary outcomes examined will include users&rsquo; engagement with the app, such as the consistency and frequency of their logging activity. 

<p>Specific Aim 3.  Assess the effect of social interaction on modifying daily health behaviors.  In addition to allowing users to track their own behaviors, users will also be offered the option to communicate with and share selected processed data with other app users (&ldquo;buddies&rdquo;) that they specifically designate.  The app will provide means for users to share results of data analysis (not primary data) information with their buddies at their discretion.  This study aims to measure whether increased social interaction around daily health behaviors correlates with improvements in outcomes described in Aim 2.

<h3>How long will I take part in this research study?</h3>

<p>If you choose to participate, this study lasts for one year. After the user has used the app for one year, their app data will no longer be analyzed as part of the study; however, users are free to continue using the app if they wish.

<h3>What will happen in this research study?</h3>

<p>When users first launch the app, they will be asked to review a series of phone screens that describe the study and the relevant risks and benefits (&ldquo;informed consent&rdquo; process) so they they can decide whether or not they wish to participate in the research study (participation in the research study is required in order to use the app); if they wish to participate, users will certify their agreement with the informed consent by entering their name and an email address (the email address is only used to enable users to receive a copy of the completed informed consent document&mdash;this document&mdash;in their email. Name and email will not be associated with any app data). 

<p>Next, users will complete a baseline survey that asks their age (in years), whether or not they have type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes, and basic questions on factors relevant to type 2 diabetes, such as height and weight, their waist circumference, what medications they take for diabetes, their most recent value for their hemoglobin A1C (if they know it).

<p>During the study, user activities will fall into the following general categories:

<ul>
    <li>Survey questions: users may periodically be asked survey questions about whether they took some or all of their prescription diabetes medications, what their weight is, if they have received a new value of a hemoglobin A1C, or if their diabetes medication doses have changed. The answers to these questions will help interpret their glucose, diet and exercise data.
    <li>Glucose and diet logging: users will be asked to record the values of their self-monitored blood glucose (i.e. &ldquo;fingerstick&rdquo; glucoses), and what they eat
    <li>Passive activity measurement: the app will use the phone&rsquo;s built-in accelerometer to measure sedentary vs. active periods, steps taken, etc. No user inputs are needed.
    <li>Social interactions: users have the option to designate &lsquo;buddies&rsquo; or friends who also use the app, so that they can share progress and compete with one another. This is optional, but social interaction around their diabetes health may improve individual&rsquo;s ability to make and maintain healthy behavior changes.
    <li>Graphical and text displays and insights: the app will display the user&rsquo;s progress through a variety of graphs, and also provide text that summarizes their progress or insights gained from their logged data (e.g., what food or exercise patterns are associated with their best glucose measurements). Viewing these screens is optional but may help users understand their behaviors better and provide additional motivation.
    <li>Users can decline to answer survey questions or participate in the above tasks. In general, the more data a user enters in the app, the more accurate and informative the insights provided by the app will be.
    <li>The app will send periodic reminders about some of the activities mentioned above, e.g., to record glucose levels or to log what was eaten at a meal.
</ul>

<p><i>All information will be anonymized and secured. No written message or email content, location information or audio information will ever be stored in human-readable form. No GPS data will be collected.</i>  It will be encoded and used for statistical purposes only, and will never be published in a way that could be personally identifiable. While the study is ongoing, the captured data may be temporarily stored on the mobile phone. If so, the data will be anonymized and secured against third-party access. To automatically transfer the data from the phone, the smart phone may periodically connect with secure servers at the MIT Media Lab and/or MGH.  All captured data will be coded and personal identifiers will not be present within the data at any point.

<h3>What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research study?</h3>

<p>There are possible risks, discomforts and inconveniences associated with any research study. This study is an observation study, not a treatment study; this means that we are not testing any new drugs or therapies, and so we do not expect any medical side effects from participating. The app does not give medical advice, or make suggestions related to diabetes treatment or medications.

<p>Inconveniences could involve the time needed to enter glucose or diet information, and seeing the reminders or messages that are sent by the app. If a survey question makes you feel uncomfortable, you are free to leave questions blank; any information you provide is completely up to you. As with any smartphone app, use your common sense and follow prevailing laws in terms of when and where you use your phone. Just as you would not text while driving, do not interact with the app while driving or doing any other activities which could result in injury. You can always wait until you are in a safe place to perform any app-related tasks.

<p>The primary concern associated with this study is privacy risk. For instance, if someone sees the app on your phone screen, they may realize that you are enrolled in the study and/or have diabetes or pre-diabetes. 

<p>Several measures are put in place to protect your privacy and the privacy of your health information.

<ul>
    <li>The app will require that the user&rsquo;s phone be protected either by a password or the Apple Touch ID fingerprint sensor for security. This make sure that only the owner of the phone can enter and view the app.
    <li>Participants will chose a username to be used for the study&mdash;to maximize privacy, we would suggest that the username not resemble the user&rsquo;s actual name or contain identifying features (such as a phone number or birthday). The app will also generate a unique randomized study number for each participant that bears no relation to any identifiable information, and will be the only feature associated with participant study data from the app. Participant identifiers (username, plus the name and email used for the consent process) will be kept separated from the research data and will be only accessible to a restricted subset of the study investigators.  We will maintain an encrypted mapping between participant identifiers and the unique random study number on a computer in a physically secured Partners computer behind the Partners firewall and within the Partners IT security envelope, on an encrypted disk with login restrictions (accessible only to a restricted subset of study personnel).  Researchers analyzing the coded study data will not know the identity of the participants, will not see any identifiers, and will see only the random study number for each participant.
    <li>De-identified app-generated data will periodically be transferred off the phones in encrypted form to secured servers managed by Sage Bionetworks (their Synapse platform). Sage Bionetworks is a non-profit research organization dedicated to the advancement of science by making available to the scientific community secure data storage (including of potentially sensitive data such as genotypes) and providing a computing/database architecture to enable IRB-approved data analysis and collaborations. 
    <li>We chose to use this platform (https://www.synapse.org) because of its demonstrated track record over many years of safeguarding and managing sensitive biomedical data (e.g., including genotype data) in accordance with IRB protocols and HIPAA regulations. Synapse uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud enhanced computational capacity to store data and perform computer intensive analyses. The AWS Cloud is a large datacenter, where data is stored in secure manner, allowing each AWS customer to manage their own IT infrastructure remotely. AWS poses no additional security concerns over existing traditional local computer cluster environments. All communications are encrypted via SSL using HTTPS, SSH, or SCP when transmitting data or commands to and from the AWS. Once data is submitted, the AWS network fabric does not allow other EC2 hosts to see any data traffic not intended for them, as most ports are firewalled for both ingress and egress. Required AWS credentials include username, password, access keys, and ssh keys. Like with any other platform, Sage Bionetworks and Synapse users of the AWS capabilities must take reasonable precautions to protect their AWS credentials. (Further information about data security within AWS can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/security/#features) Partners investigators can analyze the data either on the Synapse platform or via securely transferred versions (again of de-identified data) back at secured Partners servers behind the Partners IT firewall with restricted access and requiring logins/passwords.
    <li>de-identified data may eventually be shared with academic collaborators if a collaboration would enable additional insights into T2D. This data will never be sold to any 3rd party. 
    <li>The Sage Bionetworks Synapse platform supports three &ldquo;tiers&rdquo; of data access depending on the consents and other controls associated with the data&rsquo;s generation, ranging from very wide reuse &ldquo;Tier 3&rdquo; to an intermediate, validated researcher &ldquo;Tier 2&rdquo; level and on to traditional secure cloud compute environment &ldquo;Tier 1&rdquo; where requests are evaluated before access is granted. Any eventual future collaborative uses of data from this study will be governed by Tier 1 conditions (the strictest access environment). 
    <li>Your study data will be anonymized and linked only to an identification number for our study (a study ID) that has no relation to your hospital number or any other personal information. 
    <li>assigning each user a unique, random study number that is not related to any form of identifiable information (expanded upon below). App data such as glucose values, activity levels, and diet logs will only be associated with this study number for analysis.
    <li>All study data will be stored on a secure, restricted-access server accessible only to the investigators of the study. This computer server will be secured behind the MIT or Partners computer firewall and blocked from access from everyone except study personnel.
    <li>You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time.
</ul>

<p>De-identified data may also be used for future scientific investigation conducted at MGH and MIT.

<p>We do not foresee any medical risks from participating in this study. However, study participation may involve risks that are not known at this time.

<h3>What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, some of the biggest challenges faced in lifestyle modification for patients with diabetes are difficulty in tracking their daily food, exercise and other habits, and lack of social support. The app built for this study aims to alleviate both of these, by streamlining daily tracking of diet and exercise, and providing insights, feedback and social supports to bolster their chances of success.

<p>The app will simplify onerous tasks, such as keeping a food diary.  Electronic databases of complete nutritional information are available for every food produced by a national retailer.  The app combines these data sources allowing users to more easily track what they are eating, dramatically increasing the integrity and completeness of their food diaries. 

<p>Users will also be instructed to keep with iPhone with them at all times, including while exercising.  The iPhone possesses the ability to passively capture whether the user is stationary, walking, or running.  This allows the user to keep track of their activity level without any action on their part.  As with eating habits, the app will provide the visualization tools for users to track their progress and gain insight into their behaviors. The app will also provide a convenient interface to manually enter blood glucoses, or download them from bluetooth-enabled glucometers. To ensure that users maximally benefit from this information, the app will provide visualization tools (e.g., daily activity, calories consumed, percentage of calories that are carbohydrates, glucose values being in or out of range) to facilitate tracking their behavior over time.

<p>Smartphones can also ease the burden of forming social connections that are critical to finding support as users work toward modifying their lifestyles.  The app will seek to emulate social supports, by allowing users to specify &ldquo;buddies&rdquo; who are also using the app. Achieving this level of social support is logistically challenging outside of an electronic medium.

<p>Thus, users of the app will benefit directly by greater understanding of their individual relationship between their dietary and exercise behavior and their blood glucose. Automated prompts from the app will also help users maintain recommended behaviors such as checking their blood glucose, maintaining adequate levels of moderate activity, and taking their medications as directed. More broadly, patients with T2D will ultimately benefit from this research, because this represents a new use of smartphone technology to obtain continuously logged, real-world data on diet and exercise in relation to blood glucose. In contrast, the existing large epidemiologic literature is dominated by studies using surveys of diet and activity at rare intervals (e.g., annually or every few years). Furthermore, this study will help us better understand what strategies in health apps are well received among users, encourage more durable use of the app (rather than abandonment after a few weeks), and are most effective in modifying behaviors. Thus, we believe this app may enable new insights in T2D management and behavior in a very cost effective manner, while also providing benefit to individual users

<p>Participants will receive standard of care for their medical issues plus the benefit of discussing \ activity captured by smartphone and related survey data.  These additional data may infom you and your care team about how your health is doing, and how you are doing in terms of health-related behaviors. This study will give you and your providers access to information about yourself which is not commonly available. For example, these data might include information about your sleep hours, or the amount of your physical activity, or how much time you spent interacting with other people. Overall, this study will give general insight into how smartphones can be used to manage  and improve individuals&rsquo; health. Smart phones may be useful to help motivate patients to make progress on their health goals. These benefits could benefit a large number of patients with diabetes and other chronic diseases. 

<h3>Can I still get medical care with Partners if I don&rsquo;t take part in this research study, or if I stop taking part?</h3>

<p>Yes. Regardless of where you get your medical care, your decision to participate or not will not change the medical care you get at a Partners hospital or anywhere else. Taking part in this research study is up to you.

<h3>What should I do if I want to stop taking part in the study?</h3>

<p>If you choose to start the research study, but later wish to drop out, simply contact the study investigators through the app. You may choose to leave the study at any time. Your decision will not result in any penalty or affect your medical care through your usual physicians or providers. It would be helpful if you can answer a brief survey as to the reasons you wish to stop participating, but this is optional. Afterwards, you are free to delete the app from your smartphone.

<p>The study investigators may also withdraw you from the study without your consent at any time for any reason, including if the study is cancelled.

<h3>Will I be paid to take part in this research study?</h3>

<p>There is no compensation or payment for taking part in this study.

<h3>What will I have to pay for if I take part in this research study?</h3>

<p>Participation in this study does not require you to change anything related to your phone account. The app can use either an existing mobile data plan or WiFi connections; you may configure the app to use only WiFi connections if you wish to limit impact on your data usage. 

<h3>What happens if I am injured as a result of taking part in this research study?</h3>

<p>This study does not provide any health or medical care to participants, or compensation. Because this is a nationwide study that does not provide any health care to users, in the unlikely event that you are injured as a direct result of your participation in this study, users are advised to first seek medical treatment locally. The study investigators can also be contacted through the app or through the information below to assist in obtaining appropriate medical treatment. Your medical insurance, managed care plan, other benefits program, or other third parties, if appropriate, will be billed for this treatment. You will be responsible for any associated co-payments or deductibles as required by your insurance. If costs of care related to such an injury are not covered by your medical insurance or benefits program, you may be responsible for these costs. The study sponsors will not pay charges that your insurance does not cover. Neither the offer to provide medical assistance or any actual provision of medical services shall be construed as an admission of negligence or acceptance of liability.

<p>Unanticipated injuries sometime occur in research even when no one is at fault. There are no plans to pay you or give you other compensation for an injury, should one occur. However, you are not giving up any of your legal rights by signing this form. 

<p>If you think you have been injured or have experienced a medical problem as a result of taking part in this study, contact study investigators through the app or through the information below as soon as possible. 

<h3>If I have questions or concerns about this research study, whom can I call?</h3>

<p>If you have any questions about the study, your participation in the study, or concerns or complaints about the research, you can contact the study investigator team through the app. Or, you can contact the principal investigator as below:
